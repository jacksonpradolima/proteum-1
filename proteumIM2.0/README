How to compile Proteum
-----------------------

In the base directory there is a primitive makefile which will do the job.
Improvements to the compilation and installation process are wellcome.

Currently Proteum only compiles on linux, as far as I know. I didn't try on other
OS.




How to install
---------------

After compiling the executables and scripts will be in the LINUX/bin directory.
Just copy those file where you want and it is ready to use.

How to run 
-------------

Proteum requires GCC to be installed. To use its GUI it is also necessary 
TCL/TK.

Suposing the executable files are in directory /usr/bin/proteum, run

> export PROTEUMIMHOME=/usr/bin/proteum
> export PATH=$PROTEUMIMHOME:$PATH
> proteumim

Proteum can also be run by a command line
